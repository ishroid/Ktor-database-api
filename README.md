## Ktor database API with Exposed and postgreSQL ( Clean Architecture )  

In this sample I tried to solve 4 most asked questions in Ktor.

#### How to store array of string into the database using exposed in KTOR?
#### How to "cleanly architect" a Ktor project?
#### How to use "reference" as foreign key in exposed?
#### How to code "Admin area" for ktor projects (Pending)

This API is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and uses [Ktor async framework](https://ktor.io/) and uses [Exposed Kotlin SQL Framework](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed)  with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

You can directly use this API from your mobile device to create user, and each user can create multiple issues ,You can also display all the issues on user dashboard.
